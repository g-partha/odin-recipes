        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Fish: In a bowl, combine the fish pieces with lemon juice, turmeric powder, chili powder, pepper powder, ginger-garlic paste, and curd. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Batter: In another bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, cornflour, and a pinch of salt. Add a little water to make a thick batter.</li>
            <li>Fry the Fish: Heat oil in a deep frying pan. Dip the marinated fish pieces in the batter and fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Make the Sauce: In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add the chopped onion, capsicum, and green chilies. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender.</li>
            <li>Add Sauces and Spices: Add the green chili sauce, tomato ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and black pepper powder to the pan. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine Fish and Sauce: Add the fried fish pieces to the pan and toss to coat them evenly with the sauce. Add ½ cup of water and let it simmer for a few minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the fish well.</li>
            <li>Serve: Transfer the chilli fish to a serving dish and garnish with chopped spring onions or cilantro if desired. Serve hot with steamed rice or noodles.</li>
