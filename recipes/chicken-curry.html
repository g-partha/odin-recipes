        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Curry is a flavorful and aromatic dish that brings together tender pieces of chicken simmered in a rich, creamy sauce. The curry is infused with a blend of spices including curry powder, cinnamon, and paprika, which create a warm and inviting aroma. The addition of fresh ginger and garlic adds a zesty kick, while the coconut milk and yogurt provide a luscious, creamy texture. A hint of lemon juice and cayenne pepper gives the dish a perfect balance of tanginess and heat. This comforting curry is best enjoyed over a bed of fluffy basmati rice or with warm naan bread, making it a delightful meal for any occasion.</p>
