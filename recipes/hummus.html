        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hummus is a creamy, savory dip made from blended chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 oz) can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice (about 1 large lemon)</li>
            <li>¼ cup well-stirred tahini</li>
            <li>1 small garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>2 to 3 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>Dash of ground paprika, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Chickpeas: If using canned chickpeas, drain and rinse them well. For a smoother hummus, you can peel the chickpeas by gently rubbing them between your hands and removing the skins.</li>
            <li>Blend Tahini and Lemon Juice: In a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice. Process for about 1 minute until the mixture is well blended and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add Garlic and Spices: Add the minced garlic, ground cumin, and a pinch of salt to the tahini mixture. Process for another 30 seconds, scraping down the sides as needed.</li>
            <li>Add Chickpeas: Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides, then add the remaining chickpeas and process until thick and smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add Olive Oil and Water: With the food processor running, slowly add the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of water. Process until the hummus is smooth and creamy. If the hummus is too thick, add an additional tablespoon of water until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Adjust Seasoning: Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt, lemon juice, or cumin if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve: Transfer the hummus to a serving bowl, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, and sprinkle with paprika if desired. Serve with pita bread, fresh vegetables, or use as a spread.</li>
        </ol>
